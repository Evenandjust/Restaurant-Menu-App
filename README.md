# Restaurant-Menu-App

This is a pair of simple version Android Apps for restaurant owners and clients to use. 

1. Restaurant Menu Owner: this is the owner side version. 

Owner can use this app to upload image and information of dishes to Firebase database. These information in the database will be used to generate a digital menu for client users to view and order (this part is implemented in the corresponding app called Restaurant Menu Client). Meanwhile, the owner can also check out current orders and see the details of these orders.

2. Restaurant Menu Client: this is the client side version.

Clients need to sign up an account first. Then after they sign in, they have access to the digital menu. They can look at the details of each dish, choose what they like and add to their order. Then the orders will be uploaded to Firebase database. Restaurant owner can know what current orders are from the database data via this app's owner version.
